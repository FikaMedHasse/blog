<h1>Hi, I'm FikaMedHasse!</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    I am a 17-year-old guy from Stockholm, Sweden. I decided to make a website, so I have somewhere to share
    my 2 cents, and share them with the world in an unintrusive way. I am currently studying technology at a
    gymnasium (what other parts of the world would call upper secondary school).
</p>

<h3>So, what interests me?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I like programming; comfortable with Python and trying to learn Rust (I swear I'm not elitist though)</li>
    <li>Linux enthusiast; currently using Artix linux w/ openRC and KDE + i3.</li>
    <li>I dabble in electronics as well; currently procrastinating work on a macro keyboard.</li>
</ul>
