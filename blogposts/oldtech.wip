<h1>Old Tech</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    My dad recently gave me his old work laptop that has been laying around unused for the last decade and a half. It's a Thinkpad T60 with a Core 2 Duo T2400 and 3 gigs of RAM. In other words, a real workhorse. The first thing I did was backup all the old family photos saved to the computer. When I went to install a more sensible OS than Windows XP I ran into my first problem. The processor runs a 32-bit architecture, and the Debian image I had downloaded was 64-bit.

    My elegant solution was, contrary to common sense, to change the CPU rather than use a compatible OS. I went on e-bay and ordered the top of the line processor that was compatible with the motherboard. We're talking a Core 2 Duo T7200. 2 cores, 2 GHz base clock, 4 MB cache, and a 65 nm lithography. For the low price of only 9 USD you get all that!
